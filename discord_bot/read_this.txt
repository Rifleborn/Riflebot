Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. 
Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, 
or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.
